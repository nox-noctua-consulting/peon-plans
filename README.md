## The Easy Game Server Manager

### [Peon Project](https://github.com/nox-noctua-consulting/peon)

An **OpenSource** project to assist gamers in self deploying/managing game servers.\
Intended to be a one-stop-shop for game server deployment/management.\
If run on a public/paid cloud, it is architected to try minimise costs (easy schedule/manage uptime vs downtime)\

### Peon Plans

This is the repo of all of the game server recipes/plans.

### Architecture/Rules

1. Only scripts/code to be store here. Large file pulls should be done from other sources.
2. Attempt to keep the code pool as generic as possible to maximize code reuse/supportability.

### Feature Plan

PEON is an open-source project that I am working on in my spare time (for fun).
However, if you still wish to say thanks, feel free to pick up a virtual coffee for me at Ko-fi.

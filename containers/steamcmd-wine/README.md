## The Easy Game Server Manager

### [Peon Project](https://github.com/nox-noctua-consulting/peon)

An **OpenSource** project to assist gamers in self-deploying/managing game servers.\
Intended to be a one-stop-shop for game server deployment/management.\
If run on a public/paid cloud, it is architected to try to minimise costs (easy schedule/manage uptime vs downtime)\

### Peon SteamCMD + WineHQ

The [github](https://github.com/nox-noctua-consulting/peon-plans/tree/master/containers/steamcmd-wine) repo for developing the container.

## State

> **INITIAL RELEASE**

Functionilty working as required (tested with VRising windows steam server)

## Version Info

Check [changelog](https://github.com/nox-noctua-consulting/peon-plans/blob/master/containers/steamcmd-wine/changelog.md) for more information

- Deployed with ``cm2network/steamcmd`` as a base image
- Added ``wine`` for windows emulation & ``xvfb`` for virtual console emulation (required for some wine apps when running in headless mode)

### Known Bugs

*N/A*

### Architecture/Rules

This is a base image for certain game servers that are not linux native. ``Use default [cm2network/steamcmd] if windows is not required (waaaaaaay more efficient))``

Source container provided by [Valve SteamCMD - Docker](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD#Docker)

### Feature Plan

#### *sprint 1.0.0*

- [x] Wine - Deploy windows game servers using wine
